# Ekovizyon App

The app allows users to share sustainability-themed posts, participate in events to earn points, and interact with each other. Each user has a personal profile and can visit others' profiles, with the top 20 users ranked by points. I am currently working on features to list the nearest recycling points on a map, provide directions, and verify visits for points. Additionally, users will be able to redeem their points for discount codes from sponsor companies. This application will encourage sustainable behavior and reward users for their contributions.
